Django Quick Ref
-----------------

"activate <name of virtual env>"
cd to location of project scripts
to deactivate, "deactivate"
then do "python manage.py shell" or other commands
exit() to return to cmd

- models = tables
- urls = store patterns for url naming
- create admin user



- The model, which provides the interface with the  database containing the application data;
- The view, which decides what information to present to the user and collects information from the user; and
- The controller, which manages the business logic for the application and acts as an information broker between the model and the view.

- Change your models (in models.py).
- Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
- Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
-  python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
		why is it 0001??? maybe corresponds with migration number?

- python manage.py shell   --> calls interactive console
- python manage.py runserver


- models  is main file that stores configuration.
- other important: 
	- mysite/settings: add to list of installed apps
	- polls/apps.py - add name polls
	
create admin
-------------

1. python manage.py createsuperuser
user = 'admin', history password
		
		
		



Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an HttpResponse object containing the content for the requested page, or raising an exception such as Http404. The rest is up to you.
